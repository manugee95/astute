            <p>
              Welcome! I’m Bose Okuwa, a dual-certified Psychiatric Mental
              Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP-BC) and Family Nurse Practitioner
              (FNP-C) dedicated to providing compassionate, patient-centered
              care. With over two decades of healthcare experience, I bring a
              holistic approach to mental health and primary care, ensuring that
              my patients receive the comprehensive support they need to achieve
              wellness. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>My Background & Approach</strong>
              <br />
              I began my nursing journey in 2005 as a Registered Nurse, gaining
              extensive experience in medical-surgical, telemetry, emergency
              medicine, and primary care before advancing my expertise as a
              Nurse Practitioner. Over the years, I have worked in outpatient
              clinics, home health, emergency rooms, correctional healthcare,
              and psychiatric settings, allowing me to develop a well-rounded
              understanding of patient care across diverse populations. <br />
              <br />
              As a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, my goal is to
              help individuals navigate mental health challenges with
              evidence-based treatment, therapy, and medication management. I
              believe in treating the whole person, not just the symptoms, and I
              am committed to collaborating with my patients to develop
              personalized care plans that promote emotional well-being,
              resilience, and long-term healing. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>My Commitment to You</strong> <br />I strive to create a
              safe, non-judgmental space where my patients feel heard,
              respected, and empowered. Mental health is just as important as
              physical health, and I am here to help you take the next steps
              toward a healthier, more fulfilling life. Whether you’re seeking
              support for a new diagnosis or managing a long-standing condition,
              I am here to guide you with compassion and expertise.
